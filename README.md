# Hello, Fellow GitHubers! 👋

**Important Update**: This GitHub account holds sentimental value as my childhood account, where I first explored the world of cyber security, tech, and computers. However, I have now transitioned to a new GitHub profile: [spignelon](https://github.com/spignelon), where you can find my latest projects and contributions.

## About My Journey

In my early years, I embarked on a curious journey into the realms of technology, experimenting with various projects related to cyber security, coding, and Linux on this account. It was an exciting phase of learning and exploration, and I'm grateful for the experiences it provided.

## My Growth and Transition

As I learned and grew from my childhood years, I decided to establish a new GitHub presence: [spignelon](https://github.com/spignelon). Here, I continue my passion for technology, focusing on projects related to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

## New GitHub Profile

Please join me on my new GitHub account: [spignelon](https://github.com/spignelon), where I actively work on exciting projects and contribute to the open-source community.
